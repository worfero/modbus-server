# modbus-custom
Modbus server developed from scratch over a TCP connection so I can have a better understanding of the protocol and also practice my C skills.

## Features

- Multiple client connections;

- It is capable of processing the following requests: 
    - Read Holding Register;
    - Write Multiple Holding Registers;
    - Read Input Registers;
    - Read Coils;
    - Write Multiple Coils;
    - Read Discrete Inputs;

## Limitations

- Any request type other than the specified above will return "invalid function code" exception. Other exceptions are not yet covered;

- There is a limit of 120 registers per request, be it 16-bit or 1-bit;

- There is no limit for client connections, which can be a problem;

## Testing

- I have declared an array of each type of registers and set some default values to them just for testing;

- I am using Modbus Doctor client for testing but it should work with any other client;
